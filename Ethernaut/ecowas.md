## PortScan

Lets use rustscan

command:```rustscan -a 10.8.0.2 -- -A```

`2.png`

We have 2 open ports, port 22 which runs the ssh and port 80 which runs the http service. Our enumeration will be focuesed on port 80

## Enumeration (Port 80)

Navigating to the webpage

```3.png```

We have a login page, but then we don't have a username and password

`4.png`
`5.png`

Checking the ```/profile``` directory, we see this

`6.png`

So we have `Dashboard`,`Swagger`,`IAM`,`Profile` and `About`

Lets check the Dashboard

```7```

You can see we don't have any data available, this is because we are not logged in actually

Lets check for Swagger

`8`

Ladies and Gentlemen with us here is an API target hehe

Lets start with this endpoint ```/api/v1/user/public```

`9`

We got emails and ids for 2 users, user `lilian` and user `elian`

Checking Swagger again, we have this endpoint

`10`

So we can do a password change for users once we know their user id, since we have 2 user ids, we can try to change password for one of the users.

Lets change password for user ```lilian```

`11`

You should get this response after executing

`12`

Niceeee, now we can login as user ```lilian```

```
login: lilian.mcclure@logusus.sec-dojo.com
password: Password123
```

`13`
`14`

Now that we are logged in, lets enumerate further

Going back to Swagger you should get this

`15`

Good, lets continue

`16`

In the response you got, you should see this

`17`

This means we have 5 users in total, one of the user has an access level of 50, two of those users has an access level of 99, while the last two users have an access level of 1.



Now this is where it gets crazyðŸ˜‚,

When you check the two ids we have, there's some sort of similarities

```
62fba5c1d2803ed44e507281
62fba61ed2803ed44e507282
```
From what we have above you should be able to spot 2 differences, the let me break it down further

```
62fba"5c1"d2803ed44e50728"1"
62fba"61e"d2803ed44e50728"2"
```
It should be more visible now, since there was no rate limiting on this particular target it means I can bruteforce hell out of this targetðŸ’€ðŸ˜‚

What I did was generate a wordlist using crunch, then I did a bit of rotation for that last number
