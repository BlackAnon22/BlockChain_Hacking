My teammates(LocalMen) and I participated in the picoCTF_2024 organized by Carnegie Mellon University, which took place between March 12, 2024 to March 26, 2024. It was a great learning experience and I really learnt a lot.

For this task they provided us with the username, the port the ssh service is running on, the domain to connect to and then the password. So, we can use all this to connect to the remote instance via ssh

command:```ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p 49566```

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(bl4ck4nonðŸ‘½bl4ck4non-sec)-[~/Downloads/CTF/picoCTF_2024]
â””â”€$ ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p 49566
ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net's password: 
Welcome ctf-player, here's your flag: picoCTF{s3cur3_c0nn3ct10n_45a48857}
Connection to titan.picoctf.net closed.
```
Well, connecting to the ssh instance gave us the flag

FLAG:- ```picoCTF{s3cur3_c0nn3ct10n_45a48857}```
