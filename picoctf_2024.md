My teammates(LocalMen) and I participated in the picoCTF_2024 organized by Carnegie Mellon University, which took place between March 12, 2024 to March 26, 2024. It was a great learning experience and I really learnt a lot.

For this task they provided us with the username, the port the ssh service is running on, the domain to connect to and then the password. So, we can use all this to connect to the remote instance via ssh

command:```ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p 49566```

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(bl4ck4nonðŸ‘½bl4ck4non-sec)-[~/Downloads/CTF/picoCTF_2024]
â””â”€$ ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p 49566
ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net's password: 
Welcome ctf-player, here's your flag: picoCTF{s3cur3_c0nn3ct10n_45a48857}
Connection to titan.picoctf.net closed.
```
Well, connecting to the ssh instance gave us the flag

FLAG:- ```picoCTF{s3cur3_c0nn3ct10n_45a48857}```

------------------------------------------------

## Commitment Issues (50 points)

We actually have lots of files here and they all are git files, we were told from the challenge description that "he deleted the flag he accidentally wrote down". To view the changes made to this git files we can use the command ```git show```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlockChain_Hacking/assets/67879936/323e2132-15b1-460e-9344-912cc9351999)

Well, that's our flag there 

FLAG:- ```picoCTF{s@n1t1z3_c785c319}```

----------------------------------------

## Time Machine (50 points)

We've got some git files here also, just like in the previous challenge the ```git show``` command helps us inspect files in the git repository

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlockChain_Hacking/assets/67879936/153eb578-6769-4cde-b7ee-3bc1ebd001ee)

We got our flag

FLAG:- ```picoCTF{t1m3m@ch1n3_e8c98b3a}```

## Blame Game (75 points)

unlike the previous challs the files for this chall are much, from the challenge description we are to look for the commit that's preventing the program from working. Well, ```git show``` won't work in this case actually. The guy we'll be needing in a situation like this is "grep", I called him already he's on his way hehe

command:```grep -ir "picoCTF{```

```

We got our flagðŸ˜Ž

FLAG:- ```picoCTF{@sk_th3_1nt3rn_2c6bf174}```

## Collaborative Development (75 points)

We'll be using the "Git Extractor" tool for this, you can download it [here](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools/blob/master/Extractor/extractor.sh)

To run the tool

command:```bash extractor.sh drop-in <folder you want the output to be stored at>```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlockChain_Hacking/assets/67879936/c00c6ae9-9e9f-408d-8847-7f3bdfb41d5e)

We have 4 folders here, checking each folder we have this

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlockChain_Hacking/assets/67879936/1f7036b7-0751-4113-9fbc-1fad5671457b)

The flag was scattered amongst the folder so all you have to do is rearrange i

FLAG:- ```picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_m@k3s_th3_dr3@m_w0rk_6c06cec1}```

---------------------------------------

## binhexa (100 points)
<hr>

They gave us the challenge instance to connect to 

command:```nc titan.picoctf.net 49964```

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlockChain_Hacking/assets/67879936/4be20ba1-a191-4942-b54f-ca6058777bd1)

So we are meant to search for the flag here, to get the flag we have to perform the unique operations. We can use this [website](https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/math/binary-calculator.html)

Using that website should get you to the last task, lets solve for the first task

![image](https://github.com/BlackAnon22/BlockChain_Hacking/assets/67879936/2a325e0f-c45b-4ffe-8a77-271efcd36ce3)

To enter the result of the last operation which is ```000100111110``` to hex, we can use this [website](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-hex.html)

We got our flag

FLAG:- ```picoCTF{b1tw^3se_0p3eR@tI0n_su33essFuL_d6f8047e}```
