# Task

The goal of this level is to make the balance of the contract greater than zero.

# Contract

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Force { /*
                   MEOW ?
         /\_/\   /
    ____/ o o \
    /~____  =Ã¸= /
    (______)__m_m)
                   */ }
```
This contract code appears to be an empty contract with ASCII art comment

"The best way to attack a contract is with another contract." hinted to the `selfdestruct` operation

You can read more about it [here](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/selfdestruct-solidity)

Since, they hinted us to using another contract, this means we'll have to write a contract that that accepts ether as payment and then self destructs.

Below is our attack contract

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract sendFunds {

    constructor(address payable _owner) payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Not enough");
        selfdestruct(_owner);
    }

}
```
The `sendFunds` contract transfers Ether to a specified address upon deployment and then self-destructs, ensuring the funds are sent and the contract is destroyed.

Lets get the contract address

Before we deploy the attack contract, we can check the balance of the contract

We can deploy the attack contract using forge by passing the contract address and a value of 1 wei

Checking the balance again,

The balance of the contract is no longer zero

Submitting the instance

We have successfully completed this level
